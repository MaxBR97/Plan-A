# The good old TSP problem, in an ENHANCED version with multiple optimization criterias.
# Define cities with their Cartesian coordinates, and plan an optimized route!

# Edges variable - displays the transitions between cities in the outcome.
# Visits - Displays the list of visited cities.
# Totals - Display statistics of the solution.
# Visit_Order - Displays a suggestion to an order of transitioning between the cities. Cities with value 0 are excluded from the tour.

# good settings:
# set emph opt set presolv emph aggr

# Define set of cities with embedded coordinates (name, x, y)
